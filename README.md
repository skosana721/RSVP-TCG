# RSVP-TCG
This is an RSVP app which allows user to select event list of TCG events ordered by Event DateTime and have a button to RSVP to a specific event. After clicking on the RSVP button, a modal dialog should be loaded allowing a student to capture their personal details (Name Surname, Email address, Dietary Requirements). Rsvp must saved to mongodb instance. Separate your front-end from your API code and I should be able to run your api and front-end separately.

To execute the app you click on the button which says interested and when you clicked on the button form modal pop for you to enter your info and after you enter info it submit info to database
